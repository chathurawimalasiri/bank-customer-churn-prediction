# bank-customer-churn-prediction
In this project, I will develop a machine learning model to predict which customers are at high risk of leaving a bank based on their information.

## More Information

Predicting customer churn in a bank is a common problem in the financial industry. Customer churn refers to the rate at which customers leave a business over a given period of time, usually due to dissatisfaction or the availability of better alternatives. In the context of a bank, customer churn can lead to a loss of revenue, as well as a decrease in customer satisfaction and loyalty.
